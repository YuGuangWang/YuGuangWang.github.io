Run "Demo_3min.m" or "Demo_16min.m" for a demonstration of discrete needlet approximation 
for radial basis functions on the sphere S^2.

"Demo_3min.m" computes discrete needlet approximation of order up to 5; 
it takes about 3 mins in a computer with 8-Core Intel i7 @ 2.4GHz CPU and RAM 8G;
the figures are placed in the folder "disN_fig/dN5/";
the "mat" files are stored in the folder "disN_rbf/".


"Demo_16min.m" computes discrete needlet approximation of order up to 6; 
it takes about 16 mins in a computer with 8-Core Intel i7 @ 2.4GHz CPU and RAM 8G;
the figures are placed in the folder "disN_fig/dN6/";
the "mat" files are stored in the folder "disN_rbf/".
